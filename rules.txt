The rules for FloppyPunk are built on top of the HexHack system and use two six sided dice for resolution.

["adjudication"]Adjudication

[purple::b]Intent:[-:-:-] What does the player want?
[purple::b]Approach:[-:-:-] How does their character try to get it?
[purple::b]Adjudicate:[-:-:-] Only after the player answers both questions, the Adjudicator should answer, for themself:

1. Can this Intent+Approach [green]succeed[-]?
2. Can it [red]fail[-]?
3. Does failure have [purple::b]meaningful consequences[-:-:-]?

If any answers are no, simple narration or discussion will do. If, [purple::b]only if[-], all three answers are yes, [purple::b]test[-:-:-].
